okay now i will share my app details was my app name was be nearmate and about my app is 🔹 Idea Overview
My app is a social networking platform designed to connect people based on their live location and shared goals, problems, or interests. Unlike traditional social media or dating apps, this platform helps users find like-minded individuals near them to collaborate, learn, and solve problems together.

🔹 The Problem I am Solving
Many people have goals or challenges but don’t know how to achieve them or where to find guidance. Some examples:
✅ A student wants to prepare for government exams but doesn't know where to start.
✅ Someone wants to start a business but needs advice from experienced entrepreneurs.
✅ A person is feeling lost or demotivated and wants to talk to someone with similar struggles.

In traditional social networks, people can connect globally but often don’t get local, real-time support. Your app solves this by connecting people nearby who share common interests or problems.

🔹 The Solution
Your app matches people based on:

Live Location: Users can connect with people nearby.
Common Goals: Users who have similar aspirations (e.g., becoming a police officer, learning programming, starting a business) are matched.
Similar Problems: Users facing similar challenges (e.g., job hunting, mental health, startup struggles) can connect and help each other.
Experience Level: New users can find mentors who have already achieved their goals.
The app will act like a matching platform, but instead of dating, it focuses on collaboration, learning, and support.
